        <h4>
            <b>COVID-19</b>, also known as the coronavirus disease 2019, had been a global pandemic for several years.
            Please note that the
            situation may have evolved since then. Here is a general overview based on information available until my
            last update.
        </h4>
        <br>

        <h4>
            <b>Overview:</b> COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The
            virus was first identified
            in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and it quickly spread globally, leading to a pandemic. The World Health
            Organization
            (WHO) declared it a public health emergency of international concern in January 2020.
        </h4>
        <br>

        <h4>
            <b>Transmission</b> The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs,
            sneezes, or talks. It can also
            spread by touching surfaces contaminated with the virus and then touching the face, particularly the mouth,
            nose, or
            eyes.
        </h4>
        <br>

        <h4>
            <b>Symptoms</b> COVID-19 symptoms can range from mild to severe and may include fever, cough, shortness of
            breath, fatigue, body aches,
            loss of taste or smell, sore throat, and respiratory issues. In severe cases, it can lead to pneumonia,
            acute
            respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), organ failure, and death.
        </h4>
        <br>

        <h4>
            <b>Preventive Measures</b> To reduce the spread of the virus, public health measures were widely
            implemented. These included social distancing,
            mask-wearing, frequent handwashing, and lockdowns or restrictions on movement. Vaccination campaigns were
            launched
            globally to protect individuals from severe illness and reduce the impact on healthcare systems.
